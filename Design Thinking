In the first module, we looked at what design is, what it involves, and how design innovation is applied in industry. In this module, we will look at the first step, which is about developing the thought process behind any good design. We will elaborate on the principles of human-centered design, and explain key design tools, such as personas, extreme characters, and storyboards. Then, we will establish how you can use the insights developed from these different methods and translate them into opportunities. Overall, this module will provide you with a thorough understanding of design thinking, its role in the design process, and how it relates to innovation. First, let's define design thinking in simple terms. What does design thinking mean? Well, a popular definition of this concept by Tim Brown is that design thinking matches people's needs with what is technologically feasible, and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity. Essentially, what this means is that a design thinking approach is solution focused rather than problem-focused This means that actions are orientated towards creating a preferred future. To achieve these preferred outcomes, and so increased benefits to the end-user, design thinking uses logic, imagination, intuition, and systemic reasoning. For innovation to be successful, it is critical to not only have the technical and business opportunities in place, but to also ensure that there is a real need, and a desire for the product or service that you're creating. Design thinking uses a wide array of methods to develop the finished innovative solution. We'll cover some of these methods in the next video, where we'll look at collecting data from and about real people, and translating this data into ideas and concepts. In summary, design thinking enables the integration of people's needs with the possibilities and the requirements for innovative business success.
